# ResourceManager_Metronome
Final Project for my Real-Time Programming class.

The task was to implement a Resource Manager using the C language that functions with the BlackBerry QNX Neutrino OS.

I register a "Metronome" device to the resource manager and send the device some signals through the Neutrino console.
The metronome has an API that can be accessed through messages.
The messages are then interpreted and the metronome will change it's output based on the message recieved.

What I learned:
- A firm grasp of resource managers
- A firm grasp of IPC
- A firm grasp of multi-threading and memory management
- More defensive programming techniques
